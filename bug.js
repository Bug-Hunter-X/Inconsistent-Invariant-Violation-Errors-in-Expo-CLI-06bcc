While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the Metro bundler. The error message was quite generic and unhelpful, stating something like "Invariant Violation: ...", without providing specific details about the cause of the problem.  The error occurred inconsistently, sometimes during development and sometimes during a build. Cleaning the cache and restarting the bundler didn't resolve the issue. The project involved using several third-party libraries, which made it difficult to identify the root cause of the error.
