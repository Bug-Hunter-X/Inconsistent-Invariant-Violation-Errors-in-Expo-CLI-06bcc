The solution involved a combination of approaches:

1. **Dependency Review:** Carefully examined the `package.json` file to identify any conflicting dependencies or outdated packages.  Updated all packages to their latest versions using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
2. **Cache Cleaning:** Thoroughly cleared the Expo cache using `expo prebuild --clean` and also deleting the `node_modules` directory before reinstalling dependencies.
3. **Library Investigation:** Systematically investigated each third-party library for known bugs or incompatibilities reported by the community.  Found a conflict between two libraries (Library A and Library B) that was causing the Invariant Violation.  
4. **Version Pinning:** In the `package.json`, pinned the versions of Library A and Library B to compatible versions to resolve the conflict.  After this fix, the build proceeded without error.
